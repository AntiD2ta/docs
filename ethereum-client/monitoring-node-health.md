# Monitoring Node's Health

Nethermind **1.9.46** version comes with a `Nethermind.HealthChecks.dll` plugin that allows you to monitor your Nethermind node better. It leverages the power of [AspNetCore. Diagnostics. HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks). It simply adds an`/health`endpoint to the JSON RPC service which can be used to check the Nethermind's _**liveness** -_ verify if the node is **synced** and has **at least one peer.** Useful when you don't want to query the node before it's able to provide you data available only for fully synced nodes like `eth_getBalance`. 

## **Add plugin to your node**

At the bottom of each release in the **Assets** section, the **plugins** package is included.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each Nethermind package has its `plugins` directory, this is where you need to extract contents of the **plugins** package ðŸ‘ˆ 
{% endhint %}

* [x] Download the plugins package and inside extract its content into `plugins` directory 

```text
wget https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/download/1.9.45/plugins-1.9.45-6444e38-20201201.zip
unzip plugins-1.9.45-6444e38-20201201.zip -d plugins
```

The `Nethermind.HealthChecks.dll`plugin will be automatically loaded on Nethermind start.

## Enabling and configuring Health Checks

The health checks need to be additionally enabled which can be done either through `--HealthChecks.*` flags or by adding a `"HealthChecks"` section to the config file. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="HealthChecks config section example" %}
```bash
  "HealthChecks": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "WebhooksEnabled": true,
    "WebhooksUri": "https://slack.webhook",
    "UIEnabled": true,
    "PollingInterval": 10
  }
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
JSON RPC Service needs to be enabled in order for health checks to work `--JsonRpc.Enabled true`
{% endhint %}

Each configuration option is described here: 

{% page-ref page="configuration/modules/healthchecks.md" %}

#### Enabling Health Checks without UI 

```bash
./Nethermind.Runner --HealthChecks.Enabled true
```

The `health` endpoint is now available at `localhost:8545/health` \(if your `--JsonRpc.Port` is `8545`\). We can if it is working with `curl`:

```bash
// Request
curl localhost:8545/health

// Example of response for Unhealthy node
{"status":"Unhealthy","totalDuration":"00:00:00.0015582","entries":{"node-health":{"data":{},"description":"The node has 0 peers connected","duration":"00:00:00.0003881","status":"Unhealthy","tags":[]}}}

// Example of response for Healthy node
{"status":"Healthy","totalDuration":"00:00:00.0015582","entries":{"node-health":{"data":{},"description":"The node is now fully synced with a network, number of peers: 99","duration":"00:00:00.0003881","status":"Healthy","tags":[]}}}
```

* **Unhealthy** returns **503** \(Service Unavailable\) status code
* **Healthy** returns **200** status code

#### Enabling Health Checks UI

```bash
./Nethermind.Runner --HealthChecks.Enabled true --HealthChecks.UIEnabled true
```

Enabling UI will expose an additional endpoint `/healthchecks-ui`and will allow seeing node's health on a nice UI. To view the UI simply go to `http://localhost:8545/healthchecks-ui`.

#### Enabling Slack reports

We may also add Slack Webhook endpoint to which our node's health will be reported. We need to pass the `--HealthChecks.WebhooksEnabled true` and add  the `--HealthChecks.WebhooksUri` which can be found in your Slack app configuration.

```bash
./Nethermind.Runner --HealthChecks.Enabled true --HealthChecks.UIEnabled true --HealthChecks.WebhooksEnabled true --HealthChecks.WebhooksUri https://hooks.slack.com/
```

If your node will be **Unhealthy** you should receive the following message:

![Unhealty](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28114%29.png)

and when it becomes **Healthy** \(**synced** and with **peers**\):

![Healthy](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2846%29.png)
