# Consumer

## How can I connect to a provider?

You will need an enode of the provider you want to connect to and add it to nethermind/Data/static-nodes.json in the NDM package.

## I can't make a deposit for an asset

Check if you have connection with provider or if provider hasn't closed the asset. Also check if your account is not blocked and whether you have enough balance on your account.

## Provider closed an asset and I still haven't recieved refund

In most scenarios this is due to refund policy which holds deposit in contract for 24 more hours before proccessing the refund. If after this time you still haven't recieved refund contact with NDM support.

## How do I transfer funds to NDM wallet?

Simply transfer funds to the wallet address created by NDM.

## What happens when deposit expiries?

In case you have unused units you will get a refund for them.

## How can I unlock my account?

Right after you run NDM you will be asked to input passphrase to your account. This also happens while you change accounts.   
You can also make it in Accounts -&gt; Unlock account.

## Where can I check my deposits? 

You can do it in Deposits tab.
