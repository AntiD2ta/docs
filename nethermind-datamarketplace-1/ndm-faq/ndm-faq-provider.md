# Provider

## How can I unlock my account? 

Right after starting NDM you will be asked to input passphrase to your account. It also happens while changing accounts.

## Do I need to have my node always running in order to provide data assets for consumers?

Yes, your consumers will be able to consume your assets and place deposits only while being connected to your live node.

## Can I edit created data asset?

No, once created data asset can not be edited \(exception is plugin type\).

## Is creating data assets free?

Yes, creating data assets is free. But remember that as a provider you need money in your account, otherwise you won't send any payment claim transaction.

## What if I need to make a technical break for my data asset?

Just change assets's status from `Published` to `Under maintanace`.
